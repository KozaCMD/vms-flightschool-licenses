Thanks for downloading!
All you gotta do is drag, an drop! It's that easy. Unless you've edited your flight school test vehicles or metadata nothing is needed. If you have, just edit in client.lua.


I take ZERO credit for the flight school system itself, all credit goes to VMS, check out their store here: https://www.vames-store.com
